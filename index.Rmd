# Preface {-}

## About this book

This book is written as a companion book to the
[Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod)
Coursera class as part of the 
[Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=courseDescripTop).
However, if you do not take the class, the book mostly stands on its own. A
useful component of the book is a series of 
[YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpl-gQkQivXhr9PyOWSA3aOHf4ZNTrs90)
that comprise the Coursera class.

The book is intended to be a low cost introduction to the important field of
data products. The intended audience are students who are numerically
and computationally literate, who would like to put those skills to use in
Data Science. The book is offered for free as a series of
R Markdown documents on Github and in more convenient forms (epub, mobi) on
LeanPub.

# Introduction {-}

## What is a data product?

We'll begin this book by defining the topic of this class, data products. A data product is
the production output of a data analysis. For example, a data analysis might
build a clever machine learning algorithm. A data product embeds that algorithm
in a web site so that users can input values and get predictions. Interactive analysis web sites,
graphics, apps, R packages, presentations and reports are all data products.
In this book we focus only on a few of these components. Mostly for space reasons,
but also because our Coursera specialization covers others (like report writing).

Before beginning this book, you should be able to use R.
This language will serve as the launching point for all of our data products.
Fortunately, if you don't know R, Roger Peng has a great 
[Coursera class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming) and
[LeanPub book](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming) 
on the subject; take and read those first. The class runs every month
and both can be obtained for free.

Why R? Well for starters, it's what I know. But, also it's a very prevalent
data analysis language. Thus, it's convenient to build the data product in
the same language as the analysis is done in. In addition, the list of tools
that one needs to learn beyond R to develop data products is massive
and include: HTML, Javascript, D3, Python, Amazon Web Services, and so on. In some
sense, the tools we present are best thought of as prototyping tools
before building a larger production endeavor.
However, for many applications, they can stand alone. Shiny, in particular,
is undergoing rapid adoption, development and growth.

## The goal of this book

This book (and the corresponding class) has one simple goal: get you started
on making data products by introducing you to some very neat tools in R. We only
scratch the surface on most of these fantastic platforms, and sadly omit 
some important ones. It's best to pursue this book with a simple data project
in mind. So, before begining, think of a data oriented web app that you'd like
to create. Try using the tools in progress to create simplified 
versions of your app. Hopefully by the end you'll have a large enough toolkit
to be able to learn what you need to build your app or product.
